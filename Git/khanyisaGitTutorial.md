 ### Writing Git commands on the terminal 
 - To Create a Directory we use the follwing command 
  ` mkdir directoryOne directoryTwo directoryThree `

  - We now have to check the status of our git to know if the repository we created are on Git, we use the following command ` git status `

  - To track our folders using git we firt have to enter the directory we want to track using the following command `cd directoryOne` this will takes us into the director, we then type ` git init` to initialise the Git software thus making our Directory tracable in by git 

  - Now we initialise the git software using the following command `git init `
